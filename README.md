UNIX File System Programming in C. It simulates a simplified version of UNIX File System. It is a program that simulates the mini file system and another program that will test this file system. I was provided a sample input directory and also used to the test the feature of the file system. The test program read the files one after the other from the new file system using the file name and copy them to the output directory, and also create an simple HTML file using the output directory. The minifile system has four components: Super block, Directory structure, inode List and the Disk Block. For each file created, it has a corresponding entry in the directory structure and an inode in the inode list. The files are to be laid out contiguously on the disk, one after the other and inode hold the start and end block number indicating the first file block and last file block. And for the test program, it will take the input directory, output directory and logfile name as the arguments. First, it initialize the file system and then parse the input directory and then write each file to the mini file system, after write to the minifile system, the program will read the file form the filesystem by referring the filename and copy them to the output directory and write a HTML file.
