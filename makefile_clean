#makefile
#this makefile compiles the code test.c into
#a program called test
#which is the same as the command line:
# gcc -o test test.c
#but it breaks it into 2 steps which is very helpful in
#large projects
#the C compiler
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -g
#this rule is to link the object code into an executable
test: test.o
	$(CC) -o test test.o
#this rule is to compile the source code
test.o: test.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c test.c

	rm -f *.o
